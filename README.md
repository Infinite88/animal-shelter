# Predicting Sheltered Animals Outcomes

## Abstract

This project is a part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/). It is a supervised learning problem that uses data provided from the Kaggle and and the Austin Animal Center. A training set that contains ten features and 26,729 dat points is provided along with a dataset to test on which contains eight features with 11,456 data points.

## Requirements

In order to run the project, Python 2.7 must be installed, along with the following packages (note that the versions are those used on my machine - it is possible that the code will run with earlier versions of the packages, and almost certain that it will run with later versions):

*numpy (version 1.10.4)
*pandas (version 0.18.0)
*sklearn (version 0.17.1)
*matplotlib (version 1.3.1)
